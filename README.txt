- This mod functions for Minecraft 1.18.2 to bring two new items into the game:

1. Empty Syringe: Crafted with an iron ingot on top of a piece of glass, this can be right clicked while held to draw health away from the user and create a Syringe.
2. Syringe: This can be right-clicked on an entity to add health to them equivalent to that removed from the user originally.

- Requirements:
-- Minecraft: 1.18.2
